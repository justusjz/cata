# Cata
Cata is an experimental programming language that tries to be elegant and simple while also being
suitable for systems programming. Currently, its syntax is similar to that of Lisp (lots of
parentheses), and it only has support for basic print statements and arithmetic. This will
change quickly in the future. The current implementation is a tree-walking interpreter written in
C.
